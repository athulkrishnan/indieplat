----------------
FILE PERMISSIONS
----------------

CumulusClips needs to modify files occasionally. To do this it needs access
to the filesystem. There are two options to achive this:

1) Make the CumulusClips be owned by the user PHP is running as. Typically
this the Apache user (www-data, apache, nobody, etc.) Giving the files
777 permissions is not enough. The files have to be owned by PHP.

2) Alternatively, if there is an FTP server installed, simply provide the
FTP credentials to the installer. The user provided needs access to modify
the CumulusClips via FTP.
